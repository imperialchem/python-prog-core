      "<blockquote>Experimental work resembles the actions of a child that receives a big wraped present, and without opening it, by shaking it in his hands and hearing the sound it makes, has to infer what is inside the box and how it works. Simulation on the other hand, is like starting with an empty box, fill it with pieces that we know well, close and wrap the box, and shake it to hear the sound it makes. By comparing the two sounds, we may be able to understand nature a little better.\n",

      "\n",
      "We are aiming to create a program to discribe the motion of an ensemble of classical particles in a 2 dimentional space. Unlike the ideal gas model, we will consider that the particles possess volume (area in 2d) and therefore collide with each other. Appart from these collisions we consider no other interaction between particles. Such a system is identical to that programmed by Nick Brooks as [demonstrations for the Chemical Equilibria course](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/chemistry-teaching/chemicalequilibria/).\n",
      "\n",
      "Such simulation is one of the simplest examples of a class of simulation methods called [molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics), describing the time evolution of an ensemble of particles according to classical dynamics. In spite of its simplicity, such hard disks model is able to give insight on important results from thermodynamics, reaction kinetics, the structure of dense fluids, or phase transition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The discription of the dynamical state of the system involves the determination of the position $\\vec{r}_i(t)$ and momentum $\\vec{p}_i(t)$ (or velocity) of each particle of the system at each moment of time. For systems of N particles (where N is usually fairly large) it is in general not possible to write a closed form mathematical expression for how these quantities vary in time. The solution to this problem is to use numerical methods by which, starting from a given initial state, the system is propagated forward in time by a small discrete amount $\\Delta t$ (called a time step), and new the position and momentum are calculated for every particle for time $t+\\Delta t$. By repeating this process over and over again, it is possible to obtain a \"picture\" of the system at small intervals of time and thus monitor its evolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our simulation will thus be:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Create an ensemble of particles with positions in a bound region of space with size L&times;L, each with a well defined momenta and mass.\n",
      "* Sequentially updating the position and momenta of these particles in small time steps, keeping a registry of the configurations taken by the system over time."
